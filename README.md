# ABC Company Employee Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the employee dataset of ABC Company to uncover insights related to team distribution, employee roles, age, and salary patterns. By applying data preprocessing and analysis techniques using **Python**, the goal is to present a detailed breakdown of the workforce, highlighting key trends, salary distribution, and the relationships between different attributes.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:
1. Preprocess the dataset to clean and ensure data consistency.
2. Analyze the distribution of employees across teams and positions.
3. Identify key trends in employee age and salary distribution.
4. Visualize the findings to aid decision-making and workforce planning.

## Preprocessing Steps

Before diving into analysis, the dataset required some cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data consistency and integrity:

### Handling Missing or Invalid Data:
- The **height** column was identified as containing missing or invalid values (e.g., out-of-range heights). These values were replaced with random integers between 150 and 180 to ensure that the data was usable without introducing bias or errors.

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams
I determined how employees are distributed across different teams within the company. This task involved:
- Counting the number of employees in each team.
- Calculating the percentage distribution of employees relative to the total workforce.

This distribution helps understand the allocation of employees across teams and can provide insight into potential imbalances or understaffed teams.

### 2. Segregating Employees Based on Their Positions
Employees were categorized based on their positions within the company. This analysis included:
- Grouping employees by position.
- Analyzing the number of employees in each position to understand the workforce structure and identify areas where positions may be over or underrepresented.
### 3. Identifying the Predominant Age Group
I grouped employees into predefined age brackets and analyzed the age distribution to determine which age group has the most employees. The purpose of this analysis was to:
- Identify the age groups that dominate the workforce.
- Understand the age diversity within the company.

This information is valuable for tailoring employee programs, benefits, and career development opportunities.

### 4. Salary Expenditure Analysis by Team and Position
The project involved analyzing the salary expenditure across different teams and positions:
- I identified which **team** and **position** have the highest total salary expenditure.
- This analysis helps the company understand where the most resources are being allocated and if certain roles or teams are receiving disproportionately higher compensation.

Understanding salary expenditure is crucial for budgeting and ensuring equitable salary distribution.

### 5. Investigating the Correlation Between Age and Salary
I examined the relationship between **age** and **salary** to see if there is a correlation:
- By plotting a scatter plot and calculating the correlation coefficient, I gained insight into whether older employees tend to earn more, or if there are other factors influencing salary beyond age.
This correlation analysis provides valuable insights into salary trends within the company and can guide salary adjustments or promotional strategies.

## Visualizations

For each of the five analysis tasks, I created visualizations to represent the findings effectively:

1. **Employee Distribution by Team**:
   - A pie chart displaying the number of employees in each team, along with the percentage distribution.

2. **Employee Distribution by Position**:
   - A bar chart illustrating the number of employees in each position within the company.

3. **Age Group Distribution**:
   - A bar chart visualizing the number of employees in each age group, helping to identify the predominant age range.

4. **Salary Expenditure by Team and Position**:
   - Bar charts showing the total salary expenditure for each team and position, highlighting where the company is spending the most.

5. **Age vs Salary Correlation**:
   - A scatter plot representing the relationship between employee age and salary, with a correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship.

These visualizations aid in better understanding the trends and distributions within the workforce.

## Insights and Conclusions
### Key Insights:

1.The **age distribution** reveals that most employees fall within the 20-25 age group. The company has no employees with age above 40, reflecting a likely trend toward hiring younger professionals.

2.There is a clear positive correlation between **age and salary**, with older employees generally earning higher salaries. This suggests that the company rewards experience and tenure, with senior employees commanding higher pay. However, the correlation is not perfect, indicating that factors like position and team might also influence salary levels.
### Conclusion:
This analysis provides valuable insights that can inform ABC Companyâ€™s workforce planning, salary management, and resource allocation. The company can use these findings to optimize team structures, salary budgeting, and career development programs.
